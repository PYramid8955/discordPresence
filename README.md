# <font color="gold">discordPresence</font>

A simple python app based on pip library pypresence. 

It is made for basic users - because you have just to write data in a `settings.txt` file. 

To use app just download Discord_Presence.zip and unpack it on your desktop. (works only on windows)

If you're on linux, you have preinstalled python and can just download the source code, `settings.txt` and `guide.txt` (optional) folders.
Then, open terminal, paste following line: `pip install pypresence` and press the Enter button.

After you installed the app on your PC and configured the `settings.txt` file - make sure you have installed and opened discord on it
and open Discord_Presence.exe (or Discord_Presence.py if you're on linux) file.

If you did all things right - your presence should appear instantly!
